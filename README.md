# data-structures

this is my personal repository for studying data structures in different languages.

many of the code implementations here are from my learnings and exercises while reading the "Advanced Datastructures" book from Peter Brass. My partner gave me this book as a christmas gift since I told her I wanted to get better at data structures and algorithms.

It's a must for me that the implementations in this repository have unit tests, for my own understanding of what I'm building.
